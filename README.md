# NyxStarfield-GL

An immersive GLSL-based 3D starfield built using Three.js, featuring customizable shaders, dynamic particle effects, and vibrant Nyx-inspired colors. Perfect for showcasing shader programming and visual effects.

## Features
- Custom GLSL vertex and fragment shaders for advanced rendering.
- Vibrant, dynamic star colors inspired by cosmic aesthetics.
- Adjustable star speed, size, and count for performance tuning.
- Responsive canvas for seamless adaptation to any screen size.

git clone https://github.com/nyx4d/NyxStarfield-GL.git
cd NyxStarfield-GL

2. Open in a Browser

Simply open the index.html file in your favorite browser to see the starfield in action.
3. Customize

Modify main.js to:

    Change the starCount for more or fewer stars.
    Adjust the starSpeed for different movement dynamics.
    Update the naTVColors array for a unique color palette.

How It Works

    Vertex Shader: Dynamically calculates star positions and sizes based on depth.
    Fragment Shader: Adds circular particle shapes and vibrant color blending.
    Three.js: Manages the 3D rendering pipeline and interactive animations.
